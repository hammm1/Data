## NYC Clustering Capstone
For the IBM Data Science Profession certification I earned, the Capstone project for the course was to tie together all the skills of the lessons learned in the previous lessons and present them in a relatively free-form project. I choose to focus my data on venues in New York city.

The project uses the following libraries:
pandas, json, geopy, sklearn, matplotlib, folium


### Juypter Notebook: Python data analysis projects
General Notes:  
 * Notebooks are best viewed in Chrome. Some folium maps do not render correctly in browsers like IE
 * GitHub has issues rendering Juptyer Notebooks consistantly (issue 3035):   
   Workaround URL (copy URL to notebook into site): https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
* Folium maps do not display in GitHub. Screenshots have been attached, but maps should display in the link above.
